### Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer and AI enthusiast passionate about creating intelligent, scalable, and high-performance applications. With a strong foundation in Django, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making, I love working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree from Shahid Beheshti University, where I developed a deep interest in AI, machine learning, and backend development. My journey has been fueled by curiosity, hands-on projects, and continuous learning.
